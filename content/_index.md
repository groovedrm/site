# Don't let you day job derail your creative, innovative ideas.

Our story is simple.

We believe many insurance organizations lack the resources necessary to accelerate important evolutionary products. Key people spend their days in meetings, fighting fires, and on their never-ending work. Meanwhile, important cross-function projects suffer. Deadlines aren't met. Priorities shift. Decisions languish.

Irving Risk unblocks your team with targeted strategic help. We become your second brain that organizes and executes your ideas and projects while you focus on important work.

How are we different? We build bridges with everyone. Talk undewriting and distribution needs? Check. Dive into technical product experiences? Check. Help evaluate vendors, products, or data? Check. 

*We even look at code. On purpose. With excitment.*
